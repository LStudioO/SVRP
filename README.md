Solver for special vehicle routing problem (UAV routing)

  Unmanned aerial vehicle systems (UAS), in particular unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), are becoming more widely used. The wide functionality of the UAS and their increased availability leads to an expansion of the scope. Today UAS is used for land audits, poaching, monitoring and control of agricultural land, the delivery of drones is becoming more popular abroad. Particularly important is the use of UAS in the military sphere for tactical or strategic reconnaissance, as it allows the army not to risk personnel.

  Often during the military operation, the UAS group is used. When using the UAS group, it is important to plan the route beforehand, as opponents may intentionally create interference (radio jamming) that makes it impossible to control in real time.

  The dissertation examines the route planning of the UAS group using mobile UAV launch platforms, which is especially relevant today as the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Gremlins program, which involves launching UAV teams from existing large aircraft such as bombers, transport planes, etc.

The purpose of the project is to minimize the costs of fulfilling the tasks set by the UAS group acting as a team by optimizing their routes.
